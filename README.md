# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-with-LangChain
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain – IBM Cloud Project
This repository contains a project demonstrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, deployed and integrated with IBM Cloud services. This project was developed as part of the AI & Cloud Virtual Internship by Edunet Foundation in collaboration with IBM SkillsBuild.

What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced approach that combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate and context-aware responses. Instead of relying only on the model’s training data, it retrieves relevant documents from external sources to enrich its output.

This project showcases how to implement RAG using LangChain with a backend powered by IBM Cloud services.

Project Highlights
Document Retrieval: Searches and fetches relevant content from a custom knowledge base.

Language Model Integration: Uses a language model to generate human-like responses.

LangChain Framework: Simplifies chaining of retrieval and generation logic.

IBM Cloud Deployment: Utilizes IBM Cloud for backend hosting, storage, and APIs.

Technologies & Tools
LangChain – RAG pipeline orchestration

IBM Watson Studio / IBM Cloud Functions / Object Storage – Cloud infrastructure

FAISS / ChromaDB – For vector similarity search

OpenAI / HuggingFace Models – For LLM-based generation (optional local or API integration)

Python / Flask – Backend logic

Streamlit / HTML – Frontend UI (if applicable)
